### About

Despite the use of mostly deterministic systems based on the analysis of sound components such as amplitude and frequency, the generated outputs link up as a series of abstract and nonconventional portraits that link the fields of music, image, computing and mathematics. It seeks to broaden imagination and provide guidelines for future work. This is the result of an academic project developed for Computational Design Laboratory’s curricular unit in the Design and Multimedia Master’s program at University of Coimbra. The following section explains the process and its various stages.
